Virtual Survival - Climate Control Remastered International Edition is here!
Lonelyxiya is playing Minecraft ....
Hope team and Canoe Studio are jointly developing this modpack.
Sorry for the late update of the remastered version.
Hope your computer is okay!
The minimum i3 4170 will be able to drive this modpack?!
This modpack you do not know is developed from mainland China.
IDK, I'm just a student, not a college student!
Virtual Survival - Climate control is right for your retirement!
Hardcore mode is here! Run!
Americans, is this your first time playing with a Chinese modpack?
I believe there are Taiwanese people who will play my modpack.
Oh no, this is very scary, guys.
I am concerned that the official service is unaffordable.
Official servers need to apply for whitelist, (not recommended, because you will see Chinese mainlanders and Taiwanese)
The official server you go in and say: WTF???? What language is in there? Oh no it's simplified characters and traditional characters.
This modpack has been specially optimized and JVM parameterized to give you a significant performance boost.
Americans better not go to the official this Modpack server, because it does not support multi-language support (it will be supported in the future)
This modpack was initially developed in mainland China and was not developed internationally until around December 2021 (including the mainland version unified into an international version)
